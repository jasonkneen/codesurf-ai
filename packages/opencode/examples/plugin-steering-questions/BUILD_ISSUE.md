# Build Issue - IMPORTANT

## Problem

The built `dist/index.js` file cannot be imported due to a `jsxDEV` import error from `@opentui/solid/jsx-dev-runtime`.

```
Error: Export named 'jsxDEV' not found in module '@opentui/solid/jsx-runtime.d.ts'
```

## Root Cause

When building with Bun, the JSX transform creates imports for `jsxDEV` which don't exist in the `@opentui/solid` package. Even with proper externals configuration in `build.ts` and `bunfig.toml`, the built file still contains problematic JSX runtime imports.

## Solution

**Load the source `.tsx` file directly instead of the built `.js` file.**

In `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    "file:///path/to/plugin-steering-questions/index.tsx" // ✅ WORKS
    // NOT: "file:///path/to/plugin-steering-questions/dist/index.js"  ❌ FAILS
  ]
}
```

## Why This Works

- Bun can import and execute `.tsx` files directly at runtime
- The JSX transform happens at runtime with correct resolution
- This is how all other plugins (sidebar, etc.) are loaded

## Build Configuration

The `build.ts` and `bunfig.toml` are configured correctly for production builds, but until the jsxDEV import issue is resolved, use the source file.

### Files:

- `bunfig.toml` - Sets JSX runtime to solid-js
- `build.ts` - Externals match sidebar plugin pattern
- Both are needed for future production builds

## Verification

Test plugin loading:

```bash
bun -e "import('./index.tsx').then(m => console.log('✅ Works:', Object.keys(m)))"
bun -e "import('./dist/index.js').then(m => console.log('✅ Works')).catch(e => console.log('❌ Fails:', e.message))"
```

## For Production

### ⚠️ VERIFICATION NEEDED

Loading source `.tsx` files works in **development** (running with `bun dev`).

**Assumption**: It should also work in **production** because:

- Bun compiled executables embed the Bun runtime
- Traditional `.ts` plugins work in production
- `tsconfig.json` sets `jsxImportSource: "@opentui/solid"`
- Sidebar UI plugins use the same `.tsx` pattern

**TODO: Test this assumption**

```bash
# Build production binary
bun run build

# Run with steering plugin
./dist/codesurf-darwin-arm64/bin/codesurf
# Then test if steering questions render
```

### If Production Fails

If `.tsx` loading doesn't work in compiled executables:

1. Pre-compile plugins during OpenCode build process
2. Bundle plugins into the main executable
3. Fix the jsxDEV import issue in plugin builds
4. Ship compiled `.js` versions alongside source
